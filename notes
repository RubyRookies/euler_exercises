Rubyist notes for project Euler: * are items from meetup
(put this out on ruby list)

Some basics - 
1. How to look up types
2. How to look up methods on types
3. How to structure methods
4. How to structure recursive
5. Resources for on-going practice

Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5
1. using each Proc to do repetition
2. using modulo %
3. working with arrays 
4. .to_s and .length
* 

Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
1. multiple assignments: curr, succ = a, a+b
2. note about recursive vs. direct
* 

Problem 4 - Largest palindrome product
1. nested arrays 
2. .reverse method
3. if statement to test equality
